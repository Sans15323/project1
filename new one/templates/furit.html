                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Pusa Dwarf: These medium-sized trees produce oval to rectangular fruits weighing around 1-2 kg. They‚Äôre suitable for high-density cultivation and are dioecious, meaning fruit production occurs between separate male and female plants.</li>
                    <li>Pusa Majesty: This variety yields medium-sized, round fruits weighing approximately 1-1.5 kg. They have good taste and quality and are gynodioecious, producing fruits from both female and hermaphrodite plants.</li>
                    <li>Pusa Giants: Vigorous plants that can withstand winds, their large fruits (up to 2.5-3 kg) are useful in canning industries. Like Pusa Dwarf, they are also dioecious hybrids.</li>
                    <li>Pusa Delicious: These gynodioecious plants yield medium-sized fruits (about 1-2 kg) with deep orange flesh, fantastic flavor, and delicious taste. They‚Äôre great for the table.</li>

                    <li>Dioecious and Gynodioecious: Papaya plants in India exhibit both dioecious (separate male and female plants) and gynodioecious (female and hermaphrodite plants) characteristics. This affects fruit production and pollination.</li>
                    <li>Nutrient-Rich: Papayas are rich in vitamins (especially vitamin C), antioxidants, and enzymes. They promote digestion, boost immunity, and contribute to overall health.</li>
                    <li>Carpophore: The carpophore, a structure connecting the fruit to the stem, is prominent in Indian papayas. It‚Äôs essential for fruit development and ripening.</li>
                    <li>Fruit Shape and Color: Indian papayas come in various shapes (oval, rectangular) and colors (green, yellow, orange). The flesh is typically orange or pinkish.

                   <li> Heart Health:
